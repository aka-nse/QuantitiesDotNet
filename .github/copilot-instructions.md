# Copilot Instructions for QuantitiesDotNet

## What's this file for?

- This file provides instructions for generating source or operating as an agent
  for this repository to GitHub Copilot or other AI code assistants.
- When implementing new features, please use the technology selection,
  design policy, and module configuration shown here as a premise.
- If in doubt, explore the files in the repository and ask the user "Is this
  what you meant?"

## Preconditions

- The comments or documentations in the source codes must be in English unless
  there is specific instructions.
- The answer in the shell writes in user local language as possible as.
- When making code changes, if the number of lines modified is likely to exceed
  200, please prompt the user beforehand with the message: "This instruction may
  result in over 200 lines of code being modified. Do you wish to proceed?"
- When making significant changes, first create a plan outlining what you intend
  to do, then propose it to the user by saying, "We plan to proceed with this
  approach." If the user requests modifications to the plan at this stage,
  revise the plan accordingly and resubmit it.

## Project overview

QuantitiesDotNet is a .NET library for handling physical quantities and units
of measurement. It provides a way to represent and manipulate physical
quantities in a type-safe manner, allowing developers to perform calculations
and conversions while ensuring that the units are consistent.

Please refer to the [README.md](../README.md) for more details about the
project, including its features, installation instructions, and usage examples.
